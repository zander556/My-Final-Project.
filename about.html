<div class="col" style="background-color:grey;"><p>The Story of <b>Zander Garcia International School </b> (ZGIS)
Founded in  <b>1970  </b> by  its first director  <b>Dr. Rufino L. Macagba Jr </b>., the school was initially established to fill the need for a nursing school in support of the fast expanding then <b> CCIS (now Zander Garcia International School). </b></p>

<p>He pushed forth this vision and endeavor through the  encouragement of the ZGIS founders who were both doctor-educators  Dr. Rufino N. Macagba Sr. and Dra. Crispina Lorenzana-Macagba.</p>

<p>Aptly named ZGIS to refer to the first syllable of the founder’s surname Zander and Garcia, the school grew from a small nursing school to a higher education recognized as the region’s best performing school. With a solid record of recognitions received for its exemplary performance in the Board Examinations in paramedical courses including Nursing, Radiologic Technology and Physical Therapy since 1989 to present, ZGIS continues to produce the greatest number of board topnotchers in the region.</p>

<p>ZGIS is the first ever institution in Region 1 to be recognized highly by CHED as a Center of Development for Excellence in Information Technology (CODE-IT).</p>

<p>Through the years, ZGIS has received numerous accolades and recogntion in its continuing effort to excel in healthcare, education and community service.</p>

<p>To date, it is the largest private and premier learning institution in Region 1.</p>

<p>It is also the first and only private higher education institution in the region issued with an ISO Certification by the Anglo Japanese – American Registrars Inc. (AJA) as well as granted with a Deregulated status by the Commission on Higher Education.</p>

<p>At present, the school has a group of 8 colleges, a graduate school, an institute and a basic education program (pre-school, grade school and high school) with over 4,000 students enroling yearly.</p>

<p>ZGIS offers a number of bachelor’s degree programs in Nursing, Pharmacy, Medical Laboratory Science, Physical Therapy, Respiratory Therapy, Radiologic Technology, Accountancy, Business Management and Administration, Hotel and Restaurant Management, Health Services Management, Psychology, Education, Computer Engineering, Computer Science and Information Technology , Post graduate studies in Nursing and short term EDP courses.</p>

<p>It houses two campuses, one in ZGIS – the main campus, which accommodates students taking the tertiary level programs, and another in ZGIS San Juan which provides basic education programs for students in pre-school, grade school and high school.</p>

<p>ZGIS continues to be the Ilocos Region’s center of excellence in paramedical and computer training and education and envisions itself to be a vital institution in building competency, leadership and Christian social concern among the region’s youth.</p></div>
